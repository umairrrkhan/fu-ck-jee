                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By accessing or using the Hope JEE website and services ("Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service. Your use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of these Terms.</p>
            </section>

                <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
                <p>Hope JEE provides users with access to AI-generated question patterns and study materials ("Materials") delivered in PDF format. Our service uses advanced algorithms to analyze historical JEE question patterns and generates practice materials based on these patterns. The Materials are delivered as downloadable PDF files after purchase.</p>
                <p><strong>IMPORTANT: By using our Service, you explicitly acknowledge and agree that:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our materials are <strong>AI-GENERATED PRACTICE QUESTIONS</strong> based on pattern analysis — not actual JEE questions or direct predictions.</li>
                    <li>All success metrics and pattern analyses are <strong>REVIEWED BY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS</strong> to ensure quality and relevance.</li>
                    <li>The PDFs contain <strong>STRATEGICALLY DESIGNED QUESTIONS</strong> generated by our AI model after studying historical trends.</li>
                    <li>Our system analyzes patterns from past exams to create practice material — it does <strong>not predict or replicate</strong> actual exam questions.</li>
                    <li>PDF delivery is <strong>INSTANT AND ONE-TIME ONLY</strong> after purchase — no recurring access or logins.</li>
                    <li>Success stories and testimonials reflect feedback from students who trained using our materials, not guaranteed outcomes.</li>
                    <li>We make <strong>NO CLAIMS</strong> about overlap between our questions and those in the actual JEE exam.</li>
                    <li><strong>NO GUARANTEES</strong> are made regarding scores, ranks, or admissions — performance depends on multiple personal factors.</li>
                    <li>Any resemblance to real exam questions is <strong>PURELY COINCIDENTAL</strong> and results from statistical pattern generation.</li>
